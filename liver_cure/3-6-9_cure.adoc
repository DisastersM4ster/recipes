= Diet 3-6-9

This is a dietry plan for cleaning up your liver. It works in 3 levels. Each level is 3 days long. +
It is designed to clean and care your liver.

First rule: Eat as much as you need to be not hungry any more. Do not hunger in this diet.

The days 4 til 8 using Asparagus and/or Brussels Sprouts. Use fresh if you can. But you can also use deep frosted one if you cannot find fresh.

Buy Apples ... a lot of Apples. Calculate with 2 or more Apples per day. +
Buy Lemons (Citron, or Limette) ... a lot of them. Calculate with 2 or more every day.

The authentic Dietry Plan say "Sellery Juice" But I absolutely do not like. Selley Sticks should be fine, too. 

Always buy fruits and vegetables from organic sources if you can.

Try to reduce your consume of fat in the first 3 days. All meat contains fat, all oil is fat. +
Strictly avoid Milk, Youghurt, Cheese, Butter or any meat product (pork, beef, chicken, turkey and so on). +
From day 4 strictly avoid any kind of fat - even plant based oils like coconut oil, olive oil, rapseed oil and so on. Also avoid Nuts. +
All meat contains fat - strictly avoided from day 3.
